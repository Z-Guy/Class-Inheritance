# Classes
This was done in my earlier training with Java and learning how Java classes can interact with one another.

I made three different classes: Employee, Manager, and Executive.

The Employee class contains the inforamtion to get and show the name of the individual as well as their salary. The Manager class extends the Employee class so that it can also get the name and salary methods without having it written in its program.
